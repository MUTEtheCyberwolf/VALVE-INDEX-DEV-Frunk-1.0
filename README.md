Example Build by Towneh using the DEV Frunk 1.0 System with the EyetrackVR V4 LED Driver PCB.
# VALVE-INDEX-DEV-Frunk-1.0
Valve Index DEV Frunk 1.0 Is made to give the Index more Mounting Options for Adapters and DIY Devices. All Modifications that I create are Reversible and will not damage the Product. (Except you try to break it on purpose)
If you find spelling Mistakes in the Instructions please be patient with me I usually write them after work when Brain becomes Smoothie ^^

Custom PCB for USB-C Conversion, Fan control, and EyetrackVR Interface currently in Development.

Print Material: PETG, PA12, PA12+CF15, PLA, ASA

Supports needed: Yes (for now)

Made for M4 Screws. I recommend threaded Inserts from RUTHEX #NotSponsored
